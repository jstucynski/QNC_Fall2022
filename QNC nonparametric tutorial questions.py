# SCENARIO 1

# You are a behavioral geologist measuring the reaction time of rocks in response to a tone.
# Specifically, you want to compare the median reaction time of geodes, to that of limestone.
# You recruit 20 rocks per group, and run your reaction-time experiment.
# What test would you use to compare median reaction times between geodes and limestone, and why?

# ANSWER:
# Mann Whitney U because it's unpaired and you're comparing medians not means


# SCENARIO 2

# You are a brilliant scientist working at a biotech firm developing a vaccine that reverses aging.
# Wow! To test the efficacy of the vaccine, you recruit 50 people, give them a course of your vaccine,
# and measure their age with a (very) special scale before and after treatment.
# You want to start by refuting the simple that that the participants'
# measured ages are not changed by the treatment. What test do you use and why?

# ANSWER

# This is a paired comparison with before age and after age so Wilcoxon signed rank test


# SCENARIO 3

# You are a neuroeconomist and believe you have developed a wearable device that can change consumer preferences about a given product.
# To test your device, you present product X to a group of 40 individuals, and ask them to fill out a survery assessing how much
# they like the product (larger score means they like it more). Then, you have the individuals wear the device, present product X,
# and assess how much they like of the product. You want to know if the device reliably increases, decreases, 
# or does not affect their liking of product X. What test would you use and why?
# What result would indicate that their liking has increased?

# ANSWER

# you want to know direction of the treatment (increase or decrease or no effect on liking product X) so you'd use a Sign test
# If the sign test returns positive, it indicates an increase
